# Figures Folder

This folder contains images and diagrams used in the Docker Data Science project documentation.

## Contents

- `docker.jpg`: An illustration explaining Docker concepts and architecture.
- `port.jpg`: A diagram visualizing network port mapping in Docker containers.
- `volume.jpg`: An explanation of Docker volumes and how data persistence works across containers.

## Usage

These images are referenced in the main README.md to provide visual explanations of key Docker concepts. They help users better understand:

1. The relationship between Dockerfiles, images, and containers
2. How network ports function in containerized applications
3. Data persistence through volume mounting

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive filenames for images
- Ensure images are optimized for web viewing
- Provide text alternatives in documentation for accessibility
- Keep images up-to-date when concepts change

<div style="font-size:2.0em; font-weight:bold; text-align:center; margin-top:20px;">MNIST Visualizations Directory</div>

# 1. Overview

This directory contains visualizations and plots generated during the MNIST digit recognition project. These visualizations help understand the dataset and evaluate the performance of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.

# 2. Visualization Files

## 2.1. Dataset Visualizations

- **mnist_samples.png**: A grid visualization showing 5 examples of each digit (0-9) from the MNIST dataset.
- **digit_distribution.png**: Bar chart showing the distribution of digit classes in the training dataset.

## 2.2. Training Visualizations

- **training_history.png**: Plot showing the training and validation accuracy/loss over epochs.

## 2.3. Evaluation Visualizations

- **confusion_matrix.png**: Heatmap showing the confusion matrix of model predictions on test data.
- **prediction_samples.png**: Grid of sample digit images with their true and predicted labels.

# 3. Generating Visualizations

The visualizations are generated by running the following scripts:

```bash
# Generate dataset visualizations
python scripts/extract_sample_images.py

# Generate model training and evaluation visualizations
python scripts/train_ann.py
```

Additional visualizations can also be generated by running the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/ANN_MNIST-data.ipynb
```

# 4. Interpretation

## 4.1. Confusion Matrix

The confusion matrix shows:
- The number of correct predictions for each digit (diagonal)
- The number of misclassifications between digits (off-diagonal)
- Higher values on the diagonal indicate better model performance

## 4.2. Training History

The training history plot shows:
- How accuracy improves over training epochs
- How loss decreases over training epochs
- The gap between training and validation metrics (indicator of overfitting)
- Where early stopping occurred to prevent overfitting
